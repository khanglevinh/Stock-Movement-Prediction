# Stock-Movement-Prediction  
Developed a stock market movement prediction model using the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm. The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection,
and implementing kNN to classify stock price movements based on historical data. Focused on achieving high accuracy and optimizing model performance through parameter tuning.

**Improvement:**  
  
There are many more accurate classification algorithms that we can apply to improve our predictions, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests. However, this project provides a standard framework for using classification algorithms in making stock movement predictions, as well as portfolio movement predictions.
